# Jaiden's RPG Maker XP Scripts
A collection of scripts I've worked on for RPG Maker XP that I've decided to make available to the public.

**Please note that all scripts in this repository are provided with absolutely no warranty. Please use them at your own risk, and I am not liable for any file corruption or other issues you may run into from using these scripts.**

You are welcome to report issues, and I will look into fixing them. However, I will not be providing support for compatibility in certain projects, etc.

# Terms of Use
The scripts here are divided into directories, please be aware of their usage permission and/or license before using them. It is assumed that all of these scripts reference RPG Maker's code in some way, and thus can only be used within the RPG Maker engine.

## No Commercial Use
The scripts in this directory cannot be used in commercial projects, likely per the licensing requirements of the other scripters involved. Please respect their wishes and only use these in free projects or for learning purposes.

## Credit Required
The scripts in this directory can be used in commercial or free projects, so long as credit is provided to me. The original header should remain on the script and link back to this repository. In your game's credits, something in this format is fine:
`Script Name - Jaiden Alemni`
### Special Permissions
These scripts are derivatives of other scripters' work, and thus, on top of the requirements above, require credit to be given to those scripters. Please be sure those scripter's crediting requirements are fulfilled before using the script in your project, commercially or free.

## Free to Use
These scripts are free to use in your RPG Maker games however you'd like, and no credit is required. Have fun!

# Compatibility
Some of these scripts were written for RPG Maker XP running on the MXKP engine, which utilizes Ruby 3. They are tagged with `[RUBY3]`.

The original RGSS for RPG Maker XP was Ruby 1.8, so there will likely be some compatibility issues if you attempt to plug-and-play them into your project. I will provide some details on this where applicable, but there is no guarantee of their compatibility.

Otherwise, the scripts should work fine in any project, with detailed compatibility information written in the header of each script where applicable.
